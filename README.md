# Bikkr
Bikkr is an online game for practicing identifying the basic English vowels. It is designed to help students identify the ten long and short vowels in English. It also has a "word search" mode that challenges students to find the vowel sounds within the context of words. There are multiple modes of gameplay - individual, group vs. group, intragroup competition, speed-based, and score-based - as well as a lot of configurable options. The teacher's interface is accessed by adding /teacher/ to the URL.
